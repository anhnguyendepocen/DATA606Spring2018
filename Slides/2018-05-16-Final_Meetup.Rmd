## Announcements

### Final Exam

* Will be available later tonight.

* There are two parts:
	1. Part one has some conceptual questions.
	2. Part two has a small data set to analyze with R, then answer some interpretation questions.


## Presentations

* Krishna Rajan (7.23)
* Santosh Manjrekar (7.35)

## My Work

My research interest is in propensity score methods. Propensity score analysis (PSA) is a quasi-experimental design used to estimate causality from observational studies. It is generally conducted in two phases:

1. Estimate propensity scores (i.e. probability of being in the treatment) using the observed covariates.
	a. Check balance
	b. Re-estimate propensity scores
2. Estimate effect sizes using typical group differences (e.g. t-tests)

Areas I have worked on:

* Multilevel PSA (see [`multilevelPSA`](http://jason.bryer.org/multilevelPSA) R package)
* Matching with non-binary treatments (see [`TriMatch`](http://jason.bryer.org/TriMatch) R package)
* Bootstrapping PSA (see [`PSAboot`](http://jason.bryer.org/PSAboot) R package)
